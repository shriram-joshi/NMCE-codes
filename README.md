### Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering
This is a repository for some of the MatLab codes for the Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering course. I hope that with these codes ChemE students with no coding background can learn how to use GitHub as well learn some basic MatLab syntax. 

#How to contribute:
1. Please fork the repository if you want to make any changes/corrections/contributions to the repository.
2. Use the branch with the name 'Improvements' for pull requests.
3. Follow the camel case (Eg. firstNmceCode.m) and snake case (Eg. first_variable) naming conventions for files/classes and variables repectively.
4. Please make a proper pull request for any changes and describe them correctly so that it is easier for me to audit and merge.

> Thank you! And I hope this is of some help to you.
