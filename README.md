# Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering
This is a repository for some of the MATLAB codes for numerical methods in chemical engineering course. I hope that with these codes ChemE students with no coding background can learn how to use GitHub as well as learn some basic MatLab syntax. I have tried to make the codes as simple and uncomplicated as possible and tried to stick to solved examples in the textbook (Chapra & Canale). I havent mentioned the solved examples however the name of the codes are sufficient context. I have added necessary explanations to certain steps where necessary and will try to keep on making the codes more readable and efficient.

## How to contribute:
1. Please fork the repository if you want to make any contributions/changes/corrections to the repository.
2. Use the branch with the name 'Improvements' for pull requests.
3. Follow the camel case (Eg. firstNmceCode.m) and snake case (Eg. first_variable) naming conventions for files/classes and variables repectively.
4. Please make a proper pull request for any changes and describe them correctly so that it is easier for me to audit and merge.
5. If you need any help with the repository you can [mail me here](mailto:joshi267@purdue.edu). 

Thank you! And I hope this is of some help to you.
